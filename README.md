# Git Charged

`git-charged` is a modern, opinionated git frontend.

While the git CLI is timeless and extremely powerful, modern development
practices have changed since its inception. Many projects use centralized,
web-based git servers which enhance the workflow. `git-charged` hooks into
these modern workflows to improve usability, while maintaining
compatibility with git and other development tools.
